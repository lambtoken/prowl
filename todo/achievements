☢️ 2️⃣ Irradiated Blood

Effect:
– Whenever a unit (player or enemy) is damaged, the tile they were on becomes contaminated.
– Contaminated tiles deal damage over time to anything standing on them.
– The contamination fades after X turns unless refreshed by new bloodshed.

💡 Aggressive play spreads the hazard. The battlefield “bleeds” danger.


☢️ 3️⃣ Mutagenic Flux

Effect:
– All units slowly mutate:
  + Every 4 turns, their move and attack pattern randomly mutates (e.g. swap from Rook to Bishop pattern).
– Mutations are unpredictable but temporary — shifting again after a few turns.

💡 Radioactivity scrambles your “DNA,” adding chaos to combat styles.



🔪 CURSE: Razor Wake -- cool mechanic

Effect:
– Every time you move, you leave behind a trail of spinning blades.
– After 1 turn, the blades launch backward along your path, damaging anything they pass through — including you.
– Can create self-hazardous zones if you move carelessly.

Playstyle:
– Forces precise planning of movement. Punishes backtracking or clustering.



🎯 2. Targeted

One random enemy is always hunting you specifically — ignores other behavior patterns and obstacles.



🫥 3. No Feedback

You no longer see damage numbers, HP bars, or tile effects — everything is hidden.
(Makes play more about inference than direct feedback.)


🔥 10. Burnout

moving in same direction twice in a row stuns your


-mad chef
kill spawns a knife that goes in a random direction looping on the board. we can use stop motion mechanic for this or real time


💀 1️⃣ Grim Countdown
