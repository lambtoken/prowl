ok

listen

telegraphing enemy moves turned out to be very unfun



we have couple of issues that we need to solve first.

and i think i know how to do that, but hear me out first.



having unlimited upgrades as items is a bad idea. period.

we need to put a cap and make it so we can swap those.


i think player needs to level up too.


also we could explore team mode. with it we can probably have more complex games.



so couple of problems

1. inventory size ambiguous
2. player doesnt level up
3. late game enemy moves are difficult to predict
4. not enough items
5. objects need to spawn mid-match


ok here is what we gonna do

- player also levels up
- player entity has a max of 10 items
