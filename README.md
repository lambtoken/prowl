# Prowl

This is a weird little tactical, turn-based roguelike where you control an animal using chess-like movement patterns to get to the top of the food chain!

To win, defeat them all!

### Main mechanic
Items upgrade your **movement and attack patterns** and also have a wide array of various effects.

Unique build every playthrough!

### Game offers:
- Over **35** different animals to choose from
- Over **150** items (when all implemented)
- **10** different biomes/places
- Damage over time, status effects, crowd control, projectiles and more

## Installation

One way of playing is if you are familiar with LOVE2d, install it on your machine and just clone this repo, cd into it and run:
```lua
love .
```
However if you are on Windows and don't wanna download LOVE2d runtime, you can just download the release, unzip it and run the **exe**.

###### _Note_

Game is still under construction and there are bunch of well known bugs to be squashed and features waiting to be implemented. I am working hard on finishing the game even though time is not on my side.

Thank you!

Enjoy!
